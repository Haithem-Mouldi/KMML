# Kernel Methods data challenge

For this data challenge, kernel svm and HOG descriptors were coded from scratch and can be found in the Challenge.py file.
In order to create the submission file please type the following command line while placed in the good folder:

``
python Challenge.py
``

training may take several hours, so if you want to test that the kernel algorithm works well please change the number of training/ testing datapoints.

Please make sure that you installed the following libraries: ``scikit-learn``, ``pandas``, ``numpy``, ``scikit-image`` and ``scipy``.
The submission file will be created in the KaggleData Folder.
